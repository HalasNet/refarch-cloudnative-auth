### Introduction

This project demonstrates how to authenticate the API user using [OpenID Connect](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSD28V_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.core.doc/ae/cwlp_openid_connect.html) in the BlueCompute reference application. The MicroProfile based Authorization Server is used as an OpenID Connect Provider; the BlueCompute reference application delegates authentication and authorization to this component, which verifies the user credentials. The project contains the following components:

 - MicroProfile based Authorization Server application that handles user authentication and authorization.
 - Uses OpenID Connect 1.0 and acts as a provider to validate login credentials.
 - Return a [mpJwt](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.liberty.autogen.nd.doc/ae/rwlp_config_mpJwt.html) Bearer token back to caller for identity propagation and authorization.
 
### How it works

#### Interaction with OpenID Connect Provider

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-kubernetes/blob/microprofile/static/imgs/auth_customer_micro.png">
</p>
 
- When username/password is passed in, the Authorization microservice validates the credentials based on the details configured in the basic registry.  

#### Interaction with Resource Server API 

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-kubernetes/blob/microprofile/static/imgs/spring_auth.png">
</p>

- When a client wishes to acquire an access token to call a protected API, it calls the OpenID Connect Provider (Authorization microservice) token endpoint with the username/password of the user and requests a token with scope `blue`.
- Authorization microservice will perform the validation.
- If the username/password are valid, a mpJWT token is returned with an `access token` included in it.
- The client uses the `access token` in the `Authorization` header as a bearer token to call other Resource Servers that have the protected API (such as the [Orders microservice](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-micro-orders)).
- The service implementing the REST API verifies that the `access token` from mpJWT is valid, and then extracts the required claims from the mpJWT to identify the caller.
- The mpJWT is encoded with scope `blue` and the the expiry time in `expires_in`; once the token is generated there is no additional interaction between the Resource Server and the Auth server.

### API Endpoints

Following the [OpenID Connect endpoint URLs](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/rwlp_oidc_endpoint_urls.html), the Authorization server exposes both an authorization URI and a token URI.

- GET `/bluecomputeweb/OP/authorize`
- POST `/bluecomputeweb/OP/token`

The BlueCompute reference application supports the following clients and grant types:

- The [BlueCompute Web Application](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-bluecompute-web) using client ID `bluecomputeweb` and client secret `bluecomputewebs3cret` supports Password grant type.

The BlueCompute application has one scope, `blue`.

### Implementation

#### [Liberty app accelerator](https://liberty-app-accelerator.wasdev.developer.ibm.com/start/)

For Liberty, there is nice tool called [Liberty Accelerator](https://liberty-app-accelerator.wasdev.developer.ibm.com/start/) that generates a simple project based upon your configuration. Using this, you can build and deploy to Liberty either using the Maven or Gradle build.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-kubernetes/blob/microprofile/static/imgs/LibertyAcc_Home.png">
</p>

Just check the options of your choice and click Generate project. You can either Download it as a zip or you can create git project.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-kubernetes/blob/microprofile/static/imgs/LibertyAcc_PrjGen.png">
</p>

Once you are done with this, you will have a sample microprofile based application that you can deploy on Liberty.

Using Liberty Accelerator is your choice. You can also create the entire project manually, but using Liberty Accelerator will make things easier.

### Features

1. OpenID Connect Provider

Configure a Liberty server to act as an OpenID Connect Provider by enabling the openidConnectServer-1.0 feature in Liberty. The ssl-1.0 feature is also required for the openidConnectServer-1.0 feature. This OpenID Connect provider is built on the top OAuth Provider. So, the oauth provider should be configured as well along with the OpenID Connect provider. 

2. Basic User Registry

Liberty Server can be configured with a basic user registry by defining the users and groups information for authentication.

### Building the app

To build the application, we used maven build. Maven is a project management tool that is based on the Project Object Model (POM). Typically, people use Maven for project builds, dependencies, and documentation. Maven simplifies the project build. In this task, you use Maven to build the project.

1. Clone this repository.

   `git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-auth.git`
   
2. `cd refarch-cloudnative-auth/`

3. Checkout MicroProfile branch.

   `git checkout microprofile`

4. Run this command. This command builds the project and installs it.

   `mvn install`
   
   If this runs successfully, you will be able to see the below messages.
   
```

### Running the app and stopping it

### Pre-requisites

1. Locally in JVM

To run the Orders microservice locally in JVM, please complete the [Building the app](#building-the-app) section.

### Locally in JVM

1. Make sure you copied your SSL certificate in a file to later move to the rest protected services in the backend.

Since we are using default keystore in our server, we need to get the key from the keystore of the OpenID Provider and put it in the truststore of the backend services that are protected.

Use the below lines to copy the SSL certificate from the Authentication server.

```
cd target/liberty/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/resources/security

keytool -exportcert -keystore key.jks -storepass keypass -alias default -file libertyOP.cer
```

When this is done you see something like below.

```
Certificate stored in file <libertyOP.cer>
```

Then get back to the home folder of Auth service as below.

```
cd /Users/user@ibm.com/BlueCompute/refarch-cloudnative-auth
```

2. Start your server.

   `mvn liberty:start-server -DtestServerHttpPort=9085 -DtestServerHttpsPort=9443`

   You will see the below.
   
```
[INFO] Starting server defaultServer.
[INFO] Server defaultServer started with process ID 94296.
[INFO] Waiting up to 30 seconds for server confirmation:  CWWKF0011I to be found in /Users/user@ibm.com/BlueCompute/refarch-cloudnative-auth/target/liberty/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/logs/messages.log
[INFO] CWWKM2010I: Searching for CWWKF0011I in /Users/user@ibm.com/BlueCompute/refarch-cloudnative-auth/target/liberty/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/logs/messages.log. This search will timeout after 30 seconds.

[INFO] Finished at: 2018-03-16T16:41:04-05:00
[INFO] Final Memory: 13M/309M
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
3. Validate the auth service in the following way.

```
curl -k -d "grant_type=password&client_id=bluecomputeweb&client_secret=bluecomputewebs3cret&username=foo&password=bar&scope=blue" https://localhost:9443/oidc/endpoint/OP/token
```

Then you will see something like below.

</p>

4. If you are done accessing the application, you can stop your server using the following command.

   `mvn liberty:start-server -DtestServerHttpPort=9085 -DtestServerHttpsPort=9443`

Once you do this, you see the below messages.

```
[INFO] CWWKM2001I: Invoke command is [/Users/user@ibm.com/BlueCompute/refarch-cloudnative-auth/target/liberty/wlp/bin/server, stop, defaultServer].
